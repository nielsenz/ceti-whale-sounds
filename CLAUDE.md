# CLAUDE.md - Development Context & Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a **Sperm Whale Phonetic Alphabet Explorer** - a Python tool for analyzing whale communication patterns based on the May 2024 scientific discovery of 143+ distinct click combinations in sperm whale "language."

**Key Context**: Scientists found that sperm whales use 4 components to create their phonetic alphabet:
1. **Rhythm** - Click grouping patterns (e.g., "1+3", "2+3")
2. **Tempo** - Overall clicking speed (slow/medium/fast)
3. **Rubato** - Timing variations within patterns
4. **Ornamentation** - Extra decorative clicks

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

```
Audio Pipeline: WAV file → Click Detection → Coda Grouping → Feature Extraction → Database → Web UI
```

**Key Files & Their Purpose**:
- `src/click_detector.py` - Energy-based click detection using bandpass filtering (2-20 kHz)
- `src/coda_detector.py` - Groups clicks into communication units using inter-click intervals
- `src/feature_extractor.py` - Extracts the 4 phonetic components
- `app.py` - Streamlit web interface for researchers
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter analysis notebooks for development

### Data Sources

**Primary**: Watkins Marine Mammal Sound Database (https://cis.whoi.edu/science/B/whalesounds/)
- Files 6569, 6571, 6572, 1036, 1419 are good starting examples
- Free for research use, professionally recorded

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Audio Files
1. Place in `data/raw/` directory
2. Update `scripts/download_sample_data.py` if from new source
3. Test with existing pipeline
4. Document any special processing requirements

### Improving Click Detection
- Focus on `src/click_detector.py`
- Test on recordings with background noise
- Adjust bandpass filter parameters (currently 2-20 kHz)
- Consider adaptive thresholding methods

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Add implementation with tests
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Test on multiple whale recordings
5. Update web interface if user-facing

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Unit tests for individual components
pytest tests/test_click_detector.py

# Integration tests with real audio
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py  

# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/test_performance.py --benchmark
```

## Debugging Common Issues

### Audio Loading Problems
```python
# Always check sample rate
audio, sr = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
print(f"Sample rate: {sr}, Duration: {len(audio)/sr:.2f}s")

# Handle different formats
if sr != 44100:  # Resample if needed
    audio = librosa.resample(audio, orig_sr=sr, target_sr=44100)
```

### Click Detection Issues
- **Too many false positives**: Increase threshold multiplier (3-5x std dev)
- **Missing clicks**: Lower threshold, check frequency range
- **Processing slow**: Optimize filtering, consider downsampling

### Memory Issues with Large Files
```python
# Process in chunks for hour-long recordings
chunk_size = sr * 60  # 1 minute chunks
for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_size):
    chunk = audio[i:i+chunk_size]
    # Process chunk...
```

## Research Integration

### Output Formats
- **CSV**: For spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON**: For web applications
- **RAVEN**: For Cornell bioacoustics software
- **Audacity Labels**: For manual verification

### Collaboration with Scientists
- Marine biologists need simple, visual interfaces
- Provide confidence scores for automated detections
- Enable manual correction of automated results
- Export publication-ready figures and statistics

## Security & Ethics

### Data Handling
- All whale recordings are research data - handle responsibly
- Don't include copyrighted audio in public repositories
- Respect indigenous knowledge about marine mammals
- Follow ethical guidelines for wildlife research

### Code Security
- Validate all audio file inputs
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Use secure practices for any web-deployed versions

## Performance Optimization

### Audio Processing
```python
# Use NumPy vectorization instead of loops
# Good:
icis = np.diff(click_times)

# Avoid:
icis = [click_times[i+1] - click_times[i] for i in range(len(click_times)-1)]
```

### Memory Management
- Process audio in chunks for large files
- Use generators for batch processing
- Clear intermediate variables in loops
- Monitor memory usage with `memory_profiler`

## Deployment Considerations

### Web Interface (Streamlit)
```bash
# Local development
streamlit run app.py

# Production deployment
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8080 --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

### Cloud Processing
- Consider audio file upload size limits
- Implement progress bars for long processing
- Handle timeout issues for large recordings
- Cache processed results to avoid re-computation

## Future Roadmap

## Notes for Claude/AI Development

When working on this project:

1. **Always preserve scientific accuracy** - this is real research data
2. **Explain whale biology context** when discussing technical features
3. **Include uncertainty measures** - automated detection isn't perfect
4. **Test on multiple recordings** - whale calls vary significantly
5. **Document assumptions** - especially about click timing and grouping
6. **Consider real-world usage** - marine biologists may not be programmers
7. **Respect data sources** - credit the Watkins database and original researchers
8. **Think about conservation impact** - this work helps protect whales

The goal is creating a tool that helps humans understand whale communication better, ultimately supporting conservation efforts.
